A blog for me: [rooshi.me](http://rooshi.me)

It is heavily a **WIP** as I have little idea of what I'm really doing.

Currently the site is a React static site, but I'm currently transitioning to Jekyll for a easier way to have a blog.

# Goals
1. Have a smooth functional site to show off what work I've done, programming and otherwise, while also being able to host for free on Github Pages.
2. Have a blog where I can post things at will and without the competitive nature of Medium including:
   a.Movie and Music Album reviews
   b.Writeups for the programming projects I have taken on
